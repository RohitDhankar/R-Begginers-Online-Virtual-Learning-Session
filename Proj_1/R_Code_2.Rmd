This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

This is the 2nd in series of R Code Files.     


Refer the GitHub Repository , for all Code files ---> https://github.com/RohitDhankar/R-Beginners-Online-Virtual-Learning-Session    


Its a good practice from time to time to keep a track of our current Working Directory and list out all the Objects in our R ENVIRONMENT - specially so when we are committing changes to a Git Remote.   

# VECTOR Operations

```{r}

getwd()
#
ls()

```

We could remove any object with command - rm("Object Name")  

We can also use print() , to view any objects stored value.  


```{r}
# Code Section -1 
a1 <- "FINANCE"
b1 <- "MARKETING"
c1 <- "SALES"
d1 <- 3.1416
char_vector <- c("x","d","c","f")
print(a1)
#
print(char_vector)
#

```

Going further with VECTORS .   

We combine two or more vectors to get another vector .  


```{r}
# Code Section -2
num_vector <- c(22,22,33,33,44)
print(num_vector)
num_vector1 <- c(11,12,13,14,15)
#
num_vector3 <- c(num_vector,num_vector1)
print(num_vector3)
```

Some basic Maths and Stats with VECTORS.  


```{r}
# Code Section -3
num_vector3 + 5

# Adds NUMERIC VALUE = 5 to all ELEMENTS of the Num Vector. 

```



```{r}
# Code Section -4

num_vector1 * num_vector3
# First 5 elements of - num_vector3 multiplied by the Five Elements 
# of num_vector1 and again the Next 5 elements of num_vector3 
# multiplied by the Five Elements of num_vector1

```

Check out the LENGTH of a VECTOR with length()   


```{r}
# Code Section -5

length(num_vector1 * num_vector3)
```




```{r}
# Code Section -6

#num_vector1 %*% num_vector3 # Error in num_vector1 %*% num_vector3 : non-conformable arguments

# Vectors are not of same Length above - below they are of same length 

nv <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
nv1 <- c(6,7,8,9,10)

nv %*% nv1 # Inner Product of same Length Vectors

# Algeberic Dot Product as defined by WikiPedia - "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product"


```

Operate upon a ELEMENT of the Vector.  

```{r}
# Code Section -7


log(num_vector3[2]) # Log Base 2 of 22 
#
log(22)
#


```

Converting a CHAR Vector into a NUMERIC Vector .   


```{r}
# Code Section -8
ch_v <- c("11","12","13","14","15")
#
class(ch_v)
#ch_v + 2 # Error in ch_v + 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
# Cant do a Math operation on CHAR Vector - lets Convert into NUM Vector 
#
nm_v <- as.numeric(ch_v)
#
class(nm_v)
nm_v + 2 
#
#Summary of the Num Vector as below :- 
#
summary(nm_v+2)
#
summary(nm_v+5)
#
sum(nm_v+5)
#
sd(nm_v+5)
#
max(nm_v+5)
#
min(nm_v+5)
#
mean(nm_v+5)
#
median(nm_v+5)
#
#The Quantile - 
#
quantile(nm_v+5)
#
quantile(nm_v+100)

#
#We can also specify the Quantile buckets or Percentiles as an argument to the Quantile function :-
#
nmv_q <- c(10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,100)
percent_1 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.50,.75,.84, .97, .99))
percent_1 
boxplot(percent_1,col = "red",horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Box and Whisker Plot of Quantiles",
        xlab = "Quantile Values")
# Kindly note how the ARGUMENTs to boxplot()
# have been bumped to the next row - keeping in mind 
# the Horizontal space of our PDF knit of the .Rmd file 

# Seen above we have the MEDIAN quartile - 50% and the UPPER Quartile - 75% along with THREE more percentiles. 
```

# Intro to ANOVA and BOXPLOTS 

We also carry out ONE Way ANOVA or ANALYSIS of VARIANCE test with the BOX 
and WHISKERS plots as seen below :- 

```{r}
# Code Section -9
library(graphics)

nmv_q <- c(10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,100)
percent_1 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.50,.75,.84, .97, .99))
percent_1 

percent_2 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.1, .3, .16, .40, .50))
percent_2 

percent_3 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.16, .40, .50,.75,.84))
percent_3 

col_boxes = (c("red","blue","green"))

boxplot(percent_1,percent_2,percent_3,col = col_boxes,
        names = c("perc_1","perc_2","perc_3"),horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Box and Whisker Plot of Quantiles",
        xlab = "Quantile Values")

# Kindly note the Quantiles are randomly chosen here 
# this is not the best way to choose quantiles 
# we shall come back for details later in this text
```

# Rainbox Boxplots - 

```{r}

percent_4 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.16, .40, .50,.95,.99))
percent_4 


percent_5 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.16, .24,.32 ,.40,.75))
percent_5 

percent_6 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.1, .5, .26, .45, .60))
percent_6 


percent_7 <- quantile(nmv_q, c(.3, .7, .18, .43, .70))
percent_7 


col_rainbow <- rainbow(7)

boxplot(percent_1,percent_2,percent_3,percent_4,percent_5,percent_6,percent_7,col = col_rainbow,
        names = c("perc_1","perc_2","perc_3","perc_4","perc_5","perc_6","perc_7"),horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Box and Whisker Plot of Quantiles",
        xlab = "Quantile Values")


```




```{r}

# Just for Fun a PIE Graph --- you always 
# need to avoid PIE Graphs 


pie(rep(1, 7), col = rainbow(7))

```

# MATRICE Operations - TRANSPOSE of a MATRIX 

Coming back to MATRICES lets further look at some MATRIX Operations :- 


```{r}
# Code Section -10

m1 <- matrix(data=66:69,nrow=2,ncol=2)
m1

# Lets now TRANSPOSE this MATRIX - for more on TRANSPOSE of MATRICES 
# kindly refer this Wiki Link -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose


t(m1)

# As seen below - the DIAGONAL Elements remain as -is . 
# 66 and 69 do not move . 
# 67 and 68 switch places , thus giving us a Transpose Matrix. 

# Lets look at another example of TRANSPOSE ....

m2 <- matrix(data=10:25,nrow=4,ncol=4) 
m2
class(m2)

## Note  in the above sequence - 10:25 - both 10 and 25 are included. 
# Lets now TRANSPOSE this MATRIX - for more on TRANSPOSE of MATRICES 
# kindly refer this Wiki Link -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose

t(m2)

# As seen below - the DIAGONAL Elements remain as-is. 
# 10, 15 , 20 , 25 -- do not move . 
# Non Diagonal elements are Transposed ,giving the Transpose Matrix. 

```
# The Semicolon Notation - RANGE  or SEQUENCE

```{r}
# Code Section -11

# Quick recap of the SEQUENCE 

a_seq <- 66:69 
a_seq 

# In the earlier section we create a MATRIX by using a sequence within the COMBINE function
# We can also use the - seq - sequence function as seen below 

b_seq <- seq(from=66, to=69, by=1)
b_seq

#

b_seq <- seq(from=66, to=69, by=2)
b_seq

#

c_seq <- seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
c_seq
class(c_seq)

```

# The CBIND and RBIND Functions 

We can COLUMN Bind and ROW Bind more than one data structures as seen below - 
```{r}

ma1 <- matrix(data=10:15,nrow=3,ncol=2) 
ma1
#
class(ma1)
#
ma2 <- matrix(data=20:25,nrow=3,ncol=2) 
ma2
#
class(ma2)

# ROW Bind the Matrices 
ma3 <- rbind(ma1,ma2)
ma3
#
# COLUMN Bind the Matrices 
ma4 <- cbind(ma1,ma2)
ma4

# As seen below we need to have same COLUMN Numbers to do a RBIND
#m3 <- rbind(m1,m2)

# # As seen below we need to have same ROW Numbers to do a RBIND
m3 <- cbind(m1,m2)

```

ROW Bind Two Data Frames -
