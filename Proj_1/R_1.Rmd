This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

d1 <- 2+3
d1

array_1 <-array(1:24, dim=c(3,4,2))
array_1
```
Creating our very First Array 

```{r}
?array()

array_1 <-array(1:24, dim=c(3,4,3))
array_1
```

DIM == "Integer vector of length one or more giving the maximal indices in each dimension."
Above we have ROWS or INDEX == 3 , COLUMNS == 4 and DIMENSIONS == 3
VALUES or OBSERVATIONS are filled in COLUMNS FIRST - ROWS NEXT 



```{r}
is.array(array_1)
```


```{r}
array_2 <-array(1:24, dim=c(3,4))
array_2


```


```{r}

typeof(array_2)

```


```{r}
typeof(array_1)

```
Both ARRAYS Stored as INTEGERS in Memory 

```{r}


```

WHAT ARE - VECTORS --- One Dimension Arrays which can hold - NUMERIC , CHARACTER or LOGICAL DATA  
#
Vectors can be of THREE Types or MODES - which means the DATA TYPE they can hold.  
#  
A VECTOR is created using the - COMBINE Function()  
#  
Lets see an example of each type below -   


```{r}
num_vector <- c(22,22,33,33,44)
num_vector
char_vector <- c("x","d","c","f")
char_vector
logical_vector <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)
logical_vector  

```

SCALARS - One Element Vectors - useful for holding CONSTANT values 

```{r}
a1 <- "FINANCE"
b1 <- "MARKETING"
c1 <- "SALES"
d1 <- 3.1416
a1
b1
c1
d1

```

We refer ELEMENTS of a VECTOR by mentioning their INDEX - STARTING at 1   

Take an example of the "num_vector" from above , we REFER the 1st ELEMENT - Element 1 as below , assign it to a VAR "nm_1" and then print the value stored within the VAR :-   


```{r}

nm_1 <- num_vector[1]
nm_1

```
Below we refer value stored in Elements - 2,3 and 5 , the values as seen below are - 22, 33 and 44   


```{r}
nm_2 <- num_vector[2]
nm_3 <- num_vector[3]
nm_5 <- num_vector[5]

nm_2
nm_3
nm_5

```

We can also access a RANGE of elements by refering the INDEX of START and STOP Elements :-   


```{r}

nm_range <- num_vector[2:5]
nm_range

```

MATRICES ( Plural) MATRIX (Singular) - again like a VECTOR can store values in elements of the SAME MODE or SAME TYPE .  

Matrices are TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS of Data .   

 
```{r}
?matrix()
```
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = NULL)  


```{r}

m_1 <- matrix(data=66:99,nrow=2,ncol=2)
m_1

```
Data set has been truncated as we didnt mention enough ROWS for the MATRIX , lets try again with 5 ROWS ....   
  
  
```{r}

m_1 <- matrix(data=66:99,nrow=5,ncol=2)
m_1


```

For Data Length 34 (data being numeric values from 66 to 99) , we need to provide a "multiple" or "sub-multiple"of 34 as the ROWS value - lets try with 17.      

```{r}

m_1 <- matrix(data=66:99,nrow=17,ncol=2)
m_1


```

As seen above now the MATRIX - m_1 , can fit in the Data Values just fine with - 17 ROWS and 2 COLUMNS.   

```{r}

plot(m_1)


```

We can also reverse the ORDER of COLUMNS and ROWS   

```{r}

m_1 <- matrix(data=66:99,nrow=2,ncol=17)
m_1


```
We still derive a MATRIX - m_1 , but the plot as seen below is illegible.   

```{r}

plot(m_1)


```

#

Weve seen the basic arguments for the Function "matrix()" above - now we look at "byrow" and "dimnames".    
DimNames or Dimension Names can be a LIST of structure - LIST(ROW_NAMES,COLUMN_NAMES) .  
If we have only the 1st ELEMENT of a LIST then that defaults to ROW_NAMES and if we have a 2nd ELEMENT it defaults to COLUMN_NAMES.   
Seen below - row_names and col_names created using the COMBINE - c() , function.   



```{r}
row_names <- c("Row_Name_1","Row_Name_2") 
col_names <- c("Col_Name_1","Col_Name_2")
m_1 <- matrix(data=66:69,nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=FALSE,dimnames=list(col_names,row_names))
m_1

```
