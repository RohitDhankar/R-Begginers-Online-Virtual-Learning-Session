Good practice to keep track of current Working Directory , list all Objects in R ENVIRONMENT - specially so when committing changes to Git or any other version control Remote directory. 

# R for Finance

```{r}

library("forecast");
library("ggplot2");
library("ggfortify") 
library("tseries")


```

```{r}




```



```{r}
# Simulating Synthetic Data 

# Set Seed -- ensure reproducible results 

set.seed(123)

# . 


# Scalar Vector Constant - tweak to change DF Dimensions
aa<-1500

# 



# CHECK --- Could i have done this faster in Python ?? 


# Func - seq(as.Date ...)
# REFER -- https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.Date.html

#
# #
# head(mdf,n=20)
# #
# length(mdf$cty_name)
# #
# summary(mdf) # Summary of DF
# #
# str(mdf) # Structure of DF
# # #
# #Explicitly check the Class and Typeof 
# class(mdf$cty_name);class(mdf$country_name);class(mdf$var_dates)

```{r}




```



```{r}

# Start the clock!
# ptm <- proc.time()
# 
# vec_gross_sale <- p_sale_count_rnd*p_sale_cost_rnd
# 
# summary(vec_gross_sale)
# 
# proc.time() - ptm 
# 
#
# As seen below in our case 
# ELAPSED time - 1st 0.011 , 2nd - 0.012
# Thus the WALL CLOCK or REAL / ELAPSED 
# timings are almost same . 
#
# The USER TIME and SYSTEM TIME's in our case 
# add upto - 
# 1st - 0.008
# 2nd - 0.012

# Thus it would seem we are better off 
# with Vector Multiplication

# But we also need to consider 
# once we have the "vec_gross_sale" 
# we will need to add it to out "mdf"

# Kindly also note the Timings will
# differ for each system - also for each run 
# of the chunk of code on same sys

# Definition of user Time --- The ‘user time’ is the CPU time 
# charged for execution of user instructions of the calling process.
#

```


```{r}

# Now to multiply TWO Columns of the DF 
# Also called COLUMNAR VECTORS 

# Again start the clock!
# ptm <- proc.time()
# 
# mdf$gross_sale<- mdf$p_sale_count_rnd*mdf$p_sale_cost_rnd
# 
# proc.time() - ptm 
# #
# str(mdf)
# #
# summary(mdf)
# #
# write.csv(mdf,file="Mkt_DATA_Files/mdf.csv") 
# ## Writes to Sub Directory - DATA_Files
